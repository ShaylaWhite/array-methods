Benefits of .forEach():

Simplicity: .forEach() provides a simpler and more intuitive way to iterate over elements in an array.

Readability: The code using .forEach() is often more readable and self-explanatory, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the intention of the code.

Less Boilerplate: .forEach() eliminates the need to manage loop indices and the associated boilerplate code, reducing the chances of introducing bugs.

Functional Approach: .forEach() fits well with the functional programming paradigm, promoting cleaner code and separation of concerns.

Less Error-Prone: By abstracting away the loop control, .forEach() minimizes the possibility of common loop-related mistakes.


Here are some key reasons why .forEach() is good for arrays:

Simplicity: .forEach() simplifies the process of iterating over array elements, eliminating the need for manual loop management and index tracking.

Readability: Code that uses .forEach() is often more readable and self-explanatory, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose of the loop and the actions being performed on each element.

Functional Approach: .forEach() aligns well with the functional programming paradigm, allowing you to pass a callback function as an argument to perform a specific operation on each element.

No Index Handling: With .forEach(), you don't need to manage loop indices or worry about off-by-one errors or infinite loops.

Less Boilerplate: By abstracting away loop control and index management, .forEach() reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed compared to traditional for loops.

Array Context: Since .forEach() is a built-in method for arrays, it's optimized for array operations and can take advantage of the underlying array data structure.

Flexibility: You can use .forEach() to perform various operations on array elements, such as modifying the elements, filtering, mapping, and more.
